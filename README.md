#Test Task Information

#### In order to run the project:
* Java, JDK 8+ should be installed
* maven should be installed.

###Task divided into two parts as:

* 1st - Registration Page
* 2nd - Game Search

### 1- Registration Page Test
You will find 12 test methods inside "Task1RegistrationPageTest" class.

I tried to cover both negative and positive test scenarios in detailed while creating the methods.
You can run them one by one or all together. (If you want to execute them from terminal please refer "3- Execute all test cases in Terminal" section)

You will not run just two of them, because they were required e-mail integration, and I didn't try to integrate for now.
It can easily integrate.
* sign_up_with_wrong_pin_number_at_third_step_registration_form
* sign_up_with_valid_info

All required data for methods are coming from "utility" package -> "Utils" class.
